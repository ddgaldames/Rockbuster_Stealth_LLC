To determine the least successful actor/actress, I used the folloiwng queries with multiple joins:

SELECT E.first_name, E.last_name, COUNT(DISTINCT B.rental_id) AS number_of_rentals, SUM(amount) AS total_revenue											
FROM payment A
  INNER JOIN rental B on A.rental_id=B.rental_id
  INNER JOIN inventory C on B.inventory_id=C.inventory_id
  INNER JOIN film_actor D on C.film_id=D.film_id
  INNER JOIN actor E ON D.actor_id=E.actor_id
  GROUP BY E.first_name, E.last_name
  ORDER BY total_revenue 
LIMIT 1
