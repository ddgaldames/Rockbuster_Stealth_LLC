I also used the following code to determine how many of the top 5 customers each country has.  The inner query determines who are the top 5 customers and
the outer query counts how many customers each country has.  The left join is used so that the information from the 

SELECT D.country, COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customers_count
FROM customer A
   INNER JOIN address B ON A.adress_id=B.address_id
   INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id=C.city_id
   INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
      LEFT JOIN
      (SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city, SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
      FROM payment A
      INNER JOIN customer B on A.customer_id=B.customer_id
      INNER JOIN address C on B.address_id=C.address_id
      INNER JOIN D on C.city_id=D.city_id
      INNER E on D.country_id=E.country_id
      WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Anbattur', 'Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
      GROUP BY E.country, D.city, B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name
      ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
      LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers on D.country=top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY top_customers_count DESC
LIMIT 5
