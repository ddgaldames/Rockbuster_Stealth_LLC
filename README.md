# ROCKBUSTER_SQL

This is a project I did for my data analytics course at Career Foundry.  The primary focus for this project was learnign SQL.  


# Objective

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictitious movie rental company with stores all over the globe.  In the last few years the company has found it very difficult to compete with streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.  Due to this dramatic increase in competetion, the company has decided to launch an online movie rental company with its current movie licenses.  I provided data-driven insights to help Rockbuster launch a successful movie rental company.
