The following query was used to find the average amount paid from the top 5 customers.  It is broken down into two queries,  we have the outer query determining
the average amount paid and the inner query for finding the top 5 customers.  

Select AVG(total_amount_paid) AS avg_amount_paid
  FROM
      (SELECT
      B.customer_id,
      B.first_name,
      B.last_name,
      E.country,
      D.city,
      SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
      FROM payment A
      INNER JOIN customer B on A.customer_id=B.customer_id
      INNER JOIN address C on B.address_id=C.address_id
      INNER JOIN city D on C.city_id=D.city_id
      INNER JOIN country E on D.country_id=E.country_id
      WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
      Group BY E.country, D.city, B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name
      ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
      LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid
